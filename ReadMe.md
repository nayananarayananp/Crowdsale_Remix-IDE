### Crowdsale_Remix-IDE

The Crowdsale contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library is used to mint a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and created by this application. The crowdsale contract will oversee the entire crowdsale procedure and enable consumers to pay ether to the contract in exchange for KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens. The tokens are instantly minted by the contract, who then sells them to customers all at once.
